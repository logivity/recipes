Ingredients

    12 oz dry fettuccine
    2 cups chicken breasts boneless and skinless, cut into 1 inch pieces, about 2
    salt and pepper to taste
    2 tbsp unsalted butter
    1 stick unsalted butter
    1 cup heavy cream
    2 cups ricotta cheese
    2/3 cup freshly grated Parmesan cheese plus extra to serve
    1 tbsp fresh Parsley chopped, for garnish

Instructions

    Bring a large pot of salted water to boil. Drop in the pasta all at once and quickly bring the water back to boil, stirring occasionally. Cook the pasta for 8 to 10 minutes or until al dente. Drain well.
    Meanwhile, in a large saucepan melt the 2 tbsp of butter. Season the chicken with salt and pepper then add to the saucepan. Cook until slightly golden and cooked through, about 8 minutes. Remove the chicken from the pan and set aside.
    Melt the stick of butter over medium-high heat in the same pan then add the ricotta cheese, heavy cream, Parmesan cheese and stir to combine everything together. Bring to a boil, then reduce the heat to medium-low and simmer for about 5 minutes, stirring occasionally. Taste the sauce for salt and pepper and season as necessary.
    Add the chicken and fettuccine back to the saucepan and toss everything together and continue cooking until heated through.
    Garnish with extra Parmesan cheese and chopped parsley and serve immediately.
